Simple to complex backdoor codes

Still in development, if you want to improve you should consider become a contributor.

We want you to add more version of it!! All language are accepted.

We are just intended in:

[-] Making the bind shell can execute command correctly on both Windows and Linux

[ ] Bypass firewall

Future development:

[ ] Transfer file
(suggest for who interested: Read file as binary, encode it in base64 then send to victim's machine, put a signal that it is a file, then the victim's machine will know to decode it.)
